#This puts the path to the files into a log file.

#This counts how many data files there are.

#This will allow one to get a general idea of what the read distribution for one of the files is

#This will allow one to see some quality statistics on the data so as to gather ner information.


#Analysis Steps

#1) To get the files into .fastq and .fasta formats, poretools and poRe will be used.

#2) To correct for hybrid errors using short-read sequencing data, proovread-flex will be used.

#3) Nanocorrect will be used for de novo correction.

#4) Nanopolish will be used to correct for electrical signal events that were recorded in the .fast5 file from the MinION read.

#5) To evaluate sequence accuracy, BWA-MEM will be used.

#6) To determine assembly quality, TransRate will be used.

#7) To predict protein-coding open-reading frames, TransDecoder will be used.

#8) Use BLAST+ to query against a reference venom gland transcriptome assembly.

#9) Align and annotate sequences using CLUSTAL.
