# Adding File Census

Using the code, census = read.csv('/usr/share/data/kaggle/census.csv'), I was ab le to uplaod the data from the file being used in order to create plots like the histogram

```{R, eval=TRUE}

census = read.csv('/usr/share/data/kaggle/census.csv')

```

# Histogram of Income

I was able to create a histogram plot of the data within the file using, hist(census[,'Citizen'])

```{R, eval=TRUE}

hist(census[,'Income'])

```

# Changing Axis

By adding hist(census[,'Income'], xlab = "Income") to the end of the funtion, this changes the x-axis title. Using "ylab" would change the y-axis.

```{R, eval=TRUE}

hist(census[,'Income'], xlab = "Income")

```
