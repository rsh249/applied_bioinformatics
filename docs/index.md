# Course Description:

This course explores the growing field of Bioinformatics through hands-on and project based learning. Students will develop basic computational skills to process common biological data streams including programming in R and/or Python. The class will develop skills through a combination of hands-on tech tutorials, a survey of current bioinformatics literature, and group and individual project development.  The course will be hyper-focused around one main technology or research question but will introduce and develop computational skills that are widely transferable across Bioinformatics.

The 2019 spring semester course will focus on generating and analyzing genomic DNA sequence data produced by the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. DNA sequencing is generating massive amounts of data that are revolutionizing the way that we do biological research in nearly every area. The MinION is a benchtop, real-time DNA sequencer that is revolutionizing the field of genomics. We will be generating data and exploring bioinformatics tools available to process Nanopore data. Students will work on team and individual research associated with these data.
